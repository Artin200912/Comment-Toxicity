# Comment Toxicity Detection Model with LSTM

This project introduces a Comment Toxicity Detection model that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process and analyze text data. The model is designed to identify toxic comments, including hate speech, by analyzing the content of the text. This tool is particularly useful for moderating online platforms, social media, and forums, helping to create safer and more inclusive environments by automatically flagging potentially harmful content.

## Features

- **LSTM Text Processing**: Utilizes LSTM networks to understand the context and sentiment of text data.
- **Toxicity Detection**: Identifies toxic comments, including hate speech, based on the content of the text.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows for the customization of toxicity detection thresholds to suit different moderation needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the LSTM implementation)
- NLTK or SpaCy for natural language processing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Artin200912/Comment-Toxicity.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```
cd Comment-Toxicity
```
3. **Install the required packages:**
```
pip install -r req.txt
```
### Usage

To train the LSTM model and detect toxicity in comments, follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation or the accompanying Jupyter notebook. This will guide you through the process of setting up the LSTM architecture, training the model, and testing its toxicity detection capabilities.
